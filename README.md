# [Train Scheduler]()

An interactive scheduling app that uses a Firebase database to store information entered by the user. Local calculations are completed on the data to find real time arrivals and time until next train.

The goal of the app was to be able to add train information to the database and track those trains. The app uses Moment.js to convert times and find time to next train. Trains can also be deleted and the times update every minute through the use of javascript timers.
